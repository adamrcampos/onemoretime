        For many collegiate basketball players, March becomes the month they create their legacy and leave their mark as a player. As Jordan Poole accomplished just that with his infamous game-winner against Houston in the 2018 NCAA Tournament, his opportunity to do that for his NBA career is here. </p>
        <p>
        Over the last nine games dating back to March 3rd, Poole has been playing the best basketball of his young professional career. Averaging 22 points per game in the previous nine, it's also his longest streak of consecutive games with 20 plus points. His recent play mirrors what we saw during this past preseason. Poole put together an eye-popping five-game stretch with 21.6 points per game, and this gave Warriors fans an encouraging sign for what was to come from Poole this season. While the third-year guard is averaging 17.1 points per game for the entire season, we've seen Poole take another leap in his game with an impressive string of games throughout this month. During the Dubs/Wizards game, Poole was asked about his current mentality to credit his play at the halftime interview. He responded with what you want to hear from any hooper on your team:"Be a dog, bro." We've seen the dog come out of him over this month. There is just something about the month of March that the Michigan product loves, and it has ignited him into playing at an elite level.</p>
        <p>
        In the loss against the Celtics on Wednesday night, the mix of Stephen Curry getting hurt and one of the poorest shooting nights overall for Golden State, the game felt like a huge blow this late into the regular season. There was a silver lining to this game. We saw a third-quarter Curry-like flurry from Poole, which propelled the Warriors to come within 10 of Boston. Nineteen in the third quarter, and later finishing with 29 for the game, the young sniper gave Coach Kerr every reason to believe in him more than he already has. With the all-star guard out indefinitely, this hot streak from Poole could not have come at a better time for the Warriors.</p>
        <p>
        It's not often that we'll see this Warriors team struggle from the field like they did, and neither will we often see Klay Thompson go 1 for 12 from three. With more and more players like Wiseman, Iguodala, and Payton set to soon return from injury, the Dubs can assure the depth problem will be resolved. We also saw the potential of a Poole/Thomspon backcourt against the Bucks after the two combined for 68 points. Even with Steph missing, Golden State has every reason to stay relaxed for now. </p>
        <p>
        There are seven games left in March. With a dog mentality and the spirit of March Madness, Poole has the necessary tools to keep this team afloat in the standings. Let's get ready to dance; it's time for Poole's shining moment to prove his worth to this franchise. </p>
